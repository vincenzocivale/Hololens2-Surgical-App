# Augmented Reality Application for 3D Object Visualization with Marker Support

This repository contains the code and resources for an augmented reality application developed as part of a thesis project. The application allows users to visualize 3D models within real environments, with a focus on applications in the field of medicine, specifically surgery.

## Overview

The main objective of this thesis project was to develop an augmented reality application that allows users to visualize 3D models within real environments. The focus was on applying this technology in the field of medicine, specifically surgery, where accurate visualization of information from modern bioimaging technologies can provide significant benefits.

The software developed is enriched with interactive features based on the user's hand tracking, providing a more natural and intuitive digital experience. It uses the powerful OpenCV computer vision library to allow users to view 3D models derived from DICOM images, precisely positioned within the real environment using markers as reference points.

The application was developed using the Microsoft Hololens 2 mixed reality headset and the Unity software for creating simulated experiences. The OpenCV library was integrated into Unity using a specific plugin, and the source code was adapted to be compatible with the ARM64 processor of the Hololens 2.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open the project in Unity. Ensure that you have the OpenCV library and the necessary plugins installed.
